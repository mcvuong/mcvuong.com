            <h3>Hi, I'm Mary</h3>

                <p>
                    I'm a recent graduate from <strong><a href="https://www.rochester.edu/" target=" ">the University of Rochester</a></strong>, 
                    where I studied <strong>computer science</strong> and <strong>English</strong>. 
                    Although I'm a <strong><a href="https://www.wattpad.com/user/mcvuong" target=" ">writer</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://github.com/mcvuong" target=" ">coder</a></strong>, I love writing more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I'm a technical writer T2 for <strong><a href="https://www.bluestoneanalytics.com/" target=" ">Bluestone Analytics, a CACI company</a></strong>.
                    As a technical writer, I manage the templates, define the documentation style guides and processes, collaborate with SMEs,
                    and work on the documentation for our client deliverables. I also create scripts to automate some of our writing processes, and perform QA testing on 
                    our products to ensure our code is up to snuff. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also worked at other companies. My most recent experience is at <strong><a href="https://www.miscreants.com/" target=" ">Miscreants</a></strong>,
                    a security design agency. I worked there from June 2019-August 2022, and have mainly worked on external writing 
                    (technical posts, social media content, and SEO). However, I have also worked as a technical writer intern 
                    at <strong><a href="https://sciencelogic.com/" target=" ">ScienceLogic</a></strong>, a frontend web dev and technical writer at 
                    <strong><a href="https://www.cloudsecuritylabs.io/" target=" ">Cloud Security Labs</a></strong>, and a TA for a computer science writing course 
                    at <strong><a href="https://www.rochester.edu/" target=" ">the University of Rochester</a></strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since I've had the opportunity to work at multiple companies, 
                    I've been exposed to many tools. I have experience with all the major 
                    version control tools (such as <strong>Git</strong> and <strong>SVN</strong>), 
                    and several project management tools (such as <strong>Jira</strong>, <strong>Trello</strong>, and <strong>Click Up</strong>). 
                    I've also worked with various forms of <strong>markdown</strong>, <strong>Microsoft Word</strong>, <strong>Confluence</strong>,
                    and <strong>Madcap Flare</strong>. Being a computer science major, 
                    I also have experience working in <strong>Javascript</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>,
                    and <strong>Swift</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not writing or coding, I'm either working out, gaming, playing music, 
                    or just enjoying life.
                </p>
