            <h3>Hi, I'm Mary</h3>

                <p>
                    I'm a recent graduate from <strong><a href="https://www.rochester.edu/" target=" ">the University of Rochester</a></strong>, 
                    where I studied <strong>computer science</strong> and <strong>English</strong>. 
                    Although I'm a writer and a coder, I love writing more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I'm a technical content writer for <strong><a href="https://www.miscreants.com/" target=" ">Miscreants</a></strong>, 
                    a security design company. I've worked there since 2019, and have mainly worked on external writing 
                    (technical posts, social media content, and SEO). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also worked at other companies. My most recent experience 
                    is at <strong><a href="https://www.rochester.edu/" target=" ">the University of Rochester</a></strong> 
                    as a TA. However, I have also worked as a technical writer intern 
                    at <strong><a href="https://sciencelogic.com/" target=" ">ScienceLogic</a></strong> and as 
                    a frontend web dev and technical writer at <strong><a href="https://www.cloudsecuritylabs.io/" target=" ">Cloud Security Labs</a></strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since I've had the opportunity to work at multiple companies, 
                    I've been exposed to many tools. I have experience with all the major 
                    version control tools (such as <strong>Git</strong> and <strong>SVN</strong>), 
                    and several project management tools. I've also worked with various 
                    forms of <strong>markdown</strong>, <strong>Microsoft Word</strong>, 
                    and <strong>Madcap Flare</strong>. Being a computer science major, 
                    I also have experience working in <strong>Javascript</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, 
                    and <strong>Swift</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not writing or coding, I'm either working out, gaming, playing music, 
                    or just having a good time.
                </p>
